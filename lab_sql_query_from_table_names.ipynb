        "\n",
        "### **Objective**\n",
        "The goal of this experiment was to assess whether GPT-3.5-Turbo could accurately determine the necessary database tables for generating SQL queries based only on table names and brief descriptions. We tested this approach in three different domains: e-commerce, healthcare, and education.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Findings**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **E-CommerceBot** (Orders, Customers, Products)\n",
        "   - The model correctly identified that \"orders\" and \"customers\" were required for querying customer order history.\n",
        "   - It ignored unrelated tables like \"products\" when they were not necessary.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **HealthcareBot** (Patients, Appointments, Doctors)\n",
        "   - Successfully selected \"appointments\" and \"doctors\" for retrieving a doctor’s schedule.\n",
        "   - Did not include \"patients\" as it was not relevant to the user’s request.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **UniversityBot** (Students, Courses, Grades)\n",
        "   - Identified \"students,\" \"courses,\" and \"grades\" for retrieving student transcripts.\n",
        "   - Demonstrated the ability to recognize relationships between entities.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Challenges & Observations**\n",
        "- **Ambiguous Queries**: When user questions were vague, the model sometimes included additional tables that were not strictly necessary. For example, if asked, \"Find all details about a student’s performance,\" it might include \"students,\" \"grades,\" and \"courses\" even when \"students\" might not be needed.\n",
        "- **Hallucinations**: On rare occasions, the model inferred nonexistent table names or included tables outside the scope of the database schema.\n",
        "- **Complex Joins**: While it identified tables accurately, it did not suggest how to join them effectively, requiring additional SQL structuring by a developer.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Key Learnings**\n",
        "- **Precision in Prompting Matters**: A well-structured prompt significantly improves table selection accuracy.\n",
        "- **Model Strengths**: GPT-3.5-Turbo excels at recognizing entity relationships when given a well-defined schema.\n",
        "- **Potential Limitations**: The model lacks explicit knowledge of primary and foreign key relationships, which are critical for complex queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Conclusion**\n",
        "GPT-3.5-Turbo is a valuable tool for automating SQL query planning but requires refinement to handle complex relationships and reduce over-selection of tables. With better-defined schemas and constraints, its accuracy can be further enhanced for real-world applications.\n",
